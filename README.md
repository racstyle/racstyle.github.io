# Website: racstyle.github.io
Welcome!  This personal webpage is mainly used for keeping my DEV skills in check and perhaps show off what I can do. ðŸ™ƒ  Simply put, that means this site will definitely evolve **greatly** overtime so expect to see trash or something break once in a while. ðŸ˜…

In the meantime, while you see the chaos, check out what I (will) use in this repo in case you are interested:

<!-- # What tools were used?
- Well first off, [GitHub](https://github.com) to host my page repo (duh)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for all of my coding enDEVors (ba-dum-tssh!) ðŸ˜œ
- [CodeKit 3](https://codekitapp.com) for managing my project's npm packages, compiling/minifying code, and compiling the build folder for publishing
- [Responsively](https://responsively.app/) for checking my pages' responsiveness (yo front-end devs, you need this tool, trust me)
- [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac), only used for debugging
- [Google](https://google.com) because I am not a super programmer guru I aspire to be ðŸ˜… (although I have recently started using [ChatGPT](https://).  Yes I know, I have finally jumped into the AI chat bandwagon lol)
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com) for my motivation music because every programmer needs that awesome hackers-themed music ðŸ™ƒ (psst, you can take a listen [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4AnozME0oobxBJQX2H5ko2?si=a72acc98755a4369)!)
- [Notion.so](https://notion.so) is my DEV dashboard.  It brings together my notes, tasks, and bookmarks from all the other services I use via embedding (I dunno about you, but I love this tool)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for my DEV notes and some code TODOs.  I host it on my private GitHub repo so that I can also access them anywhere without charge via [Replit](https://replit.com).  I also use Replit to embed into my Notion dashboard.
- [TickTick](https://ticktick.com) for work/life TODOs -->

# What languages and frameworks were used?
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for project management
- [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) for the web skeleton and content
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) / [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for the appealing looks
- [Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive pages.  It used to be [Foundation Sites 6](https://get.foundation/), which based the starting point from [this repo](https://github.com/daigofuji/jekyll-foundation-6-starter), it was/is a Godsend
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for the functionality
- [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) for reusable code for my nav and footer elements (NOTE: being a newb at static pages I am, it used to be [PHP](https://php.net) but I have learned my lesson lol)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for viewing my live results on my local dev environment to see the Liquid compiled (needed to install Ruby 3.1.3 and the `jekyll` gem to get that running)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Icons8](https://icons8.com), and [Foundation Icon Fonts 3](https://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) for awesome icons!
