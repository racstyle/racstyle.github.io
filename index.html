<!-- Loop through each page -->
<!-- NOTE FOR EACH PAGE:
  - No need for front matter for these pages ONLY WHEN 'include(_relative)'-ing bc it is linked inside the 'index.html' file, which already has the 'default.html' layout, front matter ^above is just for reference.
  - BUT when you are DISPLAYING/EMBEDDING VIA (COLLECTION) LOOPING, you can do the 'title/name' and 'url' (NOT PERMALINK) front matter but still leave out 'layout'
  - Again, leave out 'layout' front matter since the pages are "embedded" inside 'index.html' file as mentioned ^above -->
