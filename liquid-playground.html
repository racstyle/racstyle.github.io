    <p>Hey, congrats on finding a secret dev page I use to debug!  This is the <strong>Liquid language debugger</strong> I use to test the Liquid language syntax for whatever I use Liquid for.</p>
    <p>Why am I keeping this here in the live site you ask?  Well, I want to make sure my local tests also works on my remote site as well!  Plus, it is fun to have people see what happens behind the scenes to see how my website came together. :D</p>

    <p>Aighty, it's about to get real, people.  This is tougher than I thought!</p>

    <p>Solution #1</p>
    <!-- Sort by year -->
    {% assign job_by_end_year = site.data.work_experiences | sort: "end_year" | group_by: "end_year" %}
    {% for year in job_by_end_year reversed %}
        {{ year.name }} Year<br>

        <!-- Sort by month -->
        {% assign job_by_end_month = year.items | sort: "end_month" | group_by: "end_month" %}
        {% for month in job_by_end_month reversed %}
            {{ month.items.first.end_month }} Month<br>

            <!-- Sort by day -->
            {% assign job_by_end_day = month.items | sort: "end_day" | group_by: "end_day" %}
            {% for day in job_by_end_day reversed %}
                {{ day.items.first.end_day }} Day<br>
            {% endfor %}    <!-- end day loop -->
            <br>
        {% endfor %}    <!-- end month loop -->
        <br>
    {% endfor %}    <!-- end year loop -->

    <p>Solution #2</p>
    <!-- Access each data point -->
    {% for job in site.data.work_experiences %}
        {{ job.end_data }} Data<br>
    
        <!-- Access each year -->
        {% assign data_data = job.end_data %}
        {{ data_data.end_yeara }} Year<br>
