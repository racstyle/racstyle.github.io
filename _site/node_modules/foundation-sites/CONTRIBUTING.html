                <h1 id="foundation-contributing-guidelines">Foundation Contributing Guidelines</h1>

<p>Although Foundation was built and maintained by ZURB for years, it is today a community project. Whether it’s bug fixing, feature development, or contributions to the ecosystem, designers and developers from all over the world help make Foundation the most advanced framework in the world.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>For <strong>bugs</strong>, <strong>feature requests</strong>, <strong>incorrect documentation</strong> or any problem you have with Foundation, you can open a new issue. If you need help to use Foundation, the <a href="https://foundation.discourse.group">Foundation Forum</a> would be more appropriate. If you aren’t sure if your issue is a bug or not, don’t worry! Post your problem on GitHub and the team will help you along.</p>

<p>Every participant is expected to follow the project’s <a href="/node_modules/foundation-sites/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> so please be courteous and respectful.</p>

<h3 id="report-a-bug">Report a bug</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Search for similar opened or closed issues</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue">link</a>).
It is likely that someone else got the same problem as you before and already reported it.</li>
  <li><strong>Make sure of the following:</strong>
    <ul class="task-list">
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />There are no <a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue">opened or closed issues</a> similar to this bug</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />This is a bug and not a missing feature</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />This bug comes from Foundation and not the browser or an other library</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />This bug is still present in the latest Foundation release</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prepare a test case with your bug</strong> (<a href="https://codepen.io/ncoden/pen/dQmVgg">link</a>).
Trying to reproduce a bug is often time-consuming. Please isolate your bug in a dedicated test case. The simpler is the test case, the best it is.</li>
  <li><strong>Create your issue</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues/new">link</a>).
Please provide a complete description of your bug: What do you expect? What happens instead? Which version of Foundation do you use, which ones are affected by the bug? Keep in mind that someone will spend a lot of time to understand your issue, make the task easy for him/her.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="request-for-a-new-feature">Request for a new feature</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Search for similar opened or closed issues</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue">link</a>).
It is likely that someone else needed a similar feature as yours and already requested it.</li>
  <li><strong>Make sure of the following:</strong>
    <ul class="task-list">
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />There are no <a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue">opened or closed issues</a> similar to your request</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />This is a missing feature and not a bug</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prepare a clear use case for the requested feature</strong>.
This will help you to make sure that this is the feature you want, and us to better understand your needs and how it would benefit to everyone the best way.</li>
  <li><strong>Create your issue</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues/new">link</a>).
Please provide a complete description of the feature you want, the use case you prepared will help you for that. After you created your issue, if you feel ready, you can start working on a pull request (please tell us so). See <a href="#contributions">Contributions</a> below.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>

<p>All new features and bug fixes should be submitted as pull requests, so the community can review and discuss them. The rule is the same for everyone, for new contributors as for Core Team members.</p>

<p>Before working on a bug fix or a new feature, please make sure of the following:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" /><strong>There is no similar pull request that was rejected or is not merged yet</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr">link</a>).
Add a comment on this pull request otherwise. Explain us why this pull request is urgent or important to you.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" /><strong>There is an open issue related to this bug or feature</strong>.
Please create one otherwise. It is often useful to talk about the bug fix or feature and the best way to implement it before working on it. You can skip this step for obvious changes (like typo in the documentation).</li>
</ul>

<p>After you made these checks, please follow these advices to create your pull requests:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Work on a dedicated Git branch</strong>.
So you default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> branch stay clean and you can open multiple Pull Requests at the same time for various issues. See (2) below for the branch name format.</li>
  <li><strong>Use our standard format for branch, commit and pull request names</strong>.
It must reference the related issue, be written in the “imperative” form (like if it was completing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">now the software should...</code>) and be prefixed by a type (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feat</code> for new feature, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fix</code> if you repair something, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs</code> for documentation, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">refactor</code> for non-breaking code cleaning, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">style</code> for code formatting, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tests</code> for unit or visual tests or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chore</code> for boring day-to-day tasks not affecting the actual code. See the <a href="https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153">AngularJs Git Commit Message Convention</a>). For example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs: improve Dropdown usage example #123</code> for commit/pull request names and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs/dropdown-improve-usage-example-123</code> for the branch name.</li>
  <li><strong>Describe everything you did and why in your commit and pull request body</strong>.
Even if you already mentioned it in the related issue, please explain what you did and for which reasons. Give references to related issues, comments, test cases or any useful resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide a clear and readable code</strong>.
Make sure that the code you changed is consistent across components and that anyone can easily understand its behavior. Split it in abstract functions, avoid code duplication and add comments when needed. You can open a “work-in-progress” pull request (prefix it with “[WIP]”) if you need any help with that.</li>
  <li><strong>Make sure that everything works and tests pass</strong>.
You must absolutely check that everything still works after your changes. Please also add tests for features you added or uncovered bugs you fixed. See the <a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites#testing">Testing</a> section.</li>
  <li><strong>Create your pull request</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/compare">link</a>).
Make sure it targets the right branch: most often <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code>, unless you provide a fix for an older version and it should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop-v...</code>. Take a look at our <a href="#git-workflow">Git Workflow</a> below.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you submit a pull request, @mention a few people you’d like to help you review it. Once those people have signed off on it, the pull request can be merged! Core Team members will handle the merge itself.</p>

<h2 id="git-workflow">Git Workflow</h2>

<p>Foundation uses a Git workflow close to the the successful <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">GitFlow</a> branching model, to which we added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop-v...</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master-v...</code> branches to prepare and release patches for older Foundation versions. Most of the time you will not have to care about this workflow and can simply open your pull request on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code>.</p>

<p>The workflow relies on three branches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code></strong></p>

    <p>Used to prepare the next minor/major version. It always contains all the new features and bug fixes, and is the most up-to-date version of Foundation. Almost every pull request should be opened on this branch (fixes, features, documentation…). When a new version is released, it is merged on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>, a dedicated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop-v...</code> branch is created, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> now targets the next version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop-&lt;version&gt;</code></strong></p>

    <p>Used to prepare patches for previous versions. For example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop-v6.5</code> to prepare the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v6.5.1</code> release. When a pull request for a bug fix is merged on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> and is compatible with supported versions, its commits must be added on the compatible <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop-v...</code> branches too. If a fix is not compatible with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code>, a pull request can be opened on the latest compatible and supported <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop-v...</code> branch. When a new patch is released, it is merged on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master-v...</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop-v...</code> now targets the next patch for this minor version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code></strong></p>

    <p>The stable branch. It only contains the latest stable version released. <strong>Do NOT open pull requests on it</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master-&lt;version&gt;</code></strong></p>

    <p>The stable branch for previous versions. For example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master-v6.5</code> for stable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v6.5.*</code> releases. <strong>Do NOT open pull requests on it</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This git workflow was fully adopted as of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v6.5</code>, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v6.4</code> and previous versions are not supported.</p>

<h2 id="coding-standards">Coding Standards</h2>

<p>If you aren’t sure how a feature should be implemented, we recommend checking out our <a href="https://github.com/foundation/foundation-standards">standards document</a>, which outlines every aspect of writing framework features, from Sass to JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="core-team">Core Team</h2>
