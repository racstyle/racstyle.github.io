# Website: racstyle.github.io
Welcome!  This personal webpage is mainly used for keeping my DEV skills in check and perhaps show off what I can do. 🙃  Simply put, that means this site will definitely evolve **greatly** overtime so expect to see trash or something break once in a while. 😅

In the meantime, while you see the chaos, check out what I (will) use in this repo in case you are interested:

# What tools were used?
- Well first off, [GitHub](https://github.com) to host my page repo (duh)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for all of my coding enDEVors (ba-dum-tssh!) 😜
- [CodeKit 3](https://codekitapp.com) for managing my frameworks and compiling/minifying code as well as compiling the build folder for publishing
- [Responsively](https://responsively.app/) for checking my pages' responsiveness (yo front-end devs, you need this tool, trust me)
- [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac), only used for debugging
- [Google](https://google.com) because I am not a super programmer guru I aspire to be 😅
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com) for my motivation music because every programmer needs that awesome hackers-themed music 🙃 (psst, you can take a listen [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4AnozME0oobxBJQX2H5ko2?si=a72acc98755a4369)!)
- [Notion.so](https://notion.so) for all my DEV tasks, notes, and bookmarks (I dunno about you, but I love this tool)

# What languages and frameworks were used?
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for project management
- [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) for the web skeleton and content
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) / [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for the appealling looks
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for the functionality
- [Foundation Sites 6](https://get.foundation/) for responsive pages (I almost gave up on this but this [repo](https://github.com/daigofuji/jekyll-foundation-6-starter/tree/gh-pages/bower_components/foundation-sites) is a Godsend)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for viewing my live results on my local dev environment
- [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) for reusable code for my nav and footer elements (NOTE: being a newb at static pages I am, it used to be [PHP](https://php.net) but I have learned my lesson lol)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Icons8](https://icons8.com), and [Foundation Icon Fonts 3](https://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) for awesome icons!

# Do I plan to implement any other languages?
Most definitely!  Here is what I plan to add to my coding playground as soon as I can:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and hopefully [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)
- [Svelte JS](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- .....And hopefully more!

The purpose of these crazy implementations are just for building my DEV skills (hence the playground), but they may end up in the main functionality of my site, who knows? 🤷🏻‍♀️

It is all experimental here, so not all of these implementations may not happen, but hey, I say it would be worth a shot! (*'Cause I am not throwing away my shot!* 😜)

# WAIT, are you still here reading this?
Well, what are you waiting for???  Now that you know what this site is about, [go check it out and enjoy](https://racstyle.github.io)!

*Got any tips, tricks, or found something, like, **ick**?  Let me know if anything can be updated or if you have any suggestions.  Thank you, God bless, and stay safe!* 😊
